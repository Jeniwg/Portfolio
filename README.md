About me:

Hi, I'm a 2D and 3D Artist currently studying Multimedia Applications and Videogame at the Lus√≥fona University of Porto. I don't have, yet, any job experience but some at game developing during Jams, as well as team work. 
I'm a fast learner and very passionate about what i want to make. Although i'm an artist, i like to code too. I know c#, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And a use mostly Unity.

I'm varied about my hobbies. I can go from a Nerd to a grandma real quick. i like videogames, movies, etc but also crochet and reading books.
